MC Generic 1.02
A Minecraft HTML5 Template
I am proud to introduce to everyone at the Minecraft Forum a stunning website template that is free to download and use on your own website. This is currently only Version 1.02, but it is extremely well constructed with an image sprite, clean CSS, CDNs, Custom Fonts, and logical and efficient HTML element nesting.
(Working hard to get IE6 (DONE!) and Mobile (AOSP,iOS) versions)
What's new?
Refined Elements
More Sidebar Styles
Color Alterations
IE6 Support!
